# ReplayGain
Modified from http://replaygain.hydrogenaud.io/proposal/mfiles/index.html to make it compatible with MATLAB 2016

Note: this is the original ReplayGain (1.x). The RG in foobar2000 has been updated to ver. 2.x, which is essentially [ITU BS.1770 Recommendation](https://www.itu.int/rec/R-REC-BS.1770/en).
